# Codebash (Project for Hackbash)
A facebook messenger bot in the form of a facebook page, where users can subscribe once, and get updates about upcoming contests on a daily basis via messenger. Also, users can get CP ratings of any user from inside messenger by sending the username to the bot.

## Technologies used:
Express, Node, Firebase, Messenger API and Postbacks.io

## Note:
If you try sending messages to the facebook page, the page would not respond unless your facebook account is added as tester to the application, since the apps aren't publicly accessible by default :(. Just send me a text and I'll add you.
